This repo contains code to explore and process the CORD-19 dataset on the COVID-19 virus. Please note that this is a work-in-progress project; most items here are sparsely-documented in the interest of running as many experiments as possible, as quickly as possible. Much of it is not elegant, but is instead merely functional.
